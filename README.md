# British Airways Data Science – Random Forest

A Random Forest classification model developed as part of the **British Airways Data Science Virtual Internship** (via Forage).  
This project analyzes customer booking behavior using the provided dataset and demonstrates model training, evaluation, and visualization.

---

##  Project Highlights
- Trains a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict customer booking outcome.
- Evaluates model using metrics like **accuracy** and **classification report**.
- Visualizes **feature importance**, **correlations**, and model performance.
